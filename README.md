#Sportdec code challenge

##Introduction
Welcome to the Sportdec coding challenge. The challenge is intended for candidates applying for development roles in our company. It's not a super-charged time challenge - you can complete it at home, in your own time. Ideally you will complete this in less than 1 week - the sooner you get your submission to us, the sooner we can progess your application.

    A little bit about us
    Sportdec is a sports companion app for sports fans. What's a sports companion app? 
    Well, we see it as providing fans with features and fun to compliment their 
    following of live games. That includes:
     * Realtime updates and notificaations on match scores and events :soccer:
     * Match, team and players stats
     * Orginal sport content of a fan's favourite teams
     * Pre- and live-match money wagering
     * Sports games
     * And much more...


##The Challenge
This assignment asks you to deliver a mobile web app that displays an overview of a real football match.
In this repo you'll find the JSON data that describes what happened in the match and when it happened. You'll also find image assets you might need to render an interesting user experience. What we are looking for is a solution that clearly describes to the user the timeline of events in the match - the chronology of events should tell the user all she needs to understand what happened in the game and when. 

Other than that, we are being deliberately non-specific on visual layout - that's up to you. We encourage you to use your imagination to come up with a solution. We love surprises!

Technically, your solution should do the following:
* Demonstrate the use services or controllers that interact with the JSON file as the data source for the interface  
* Demonstrate the implementation of styles in a way that is easy to manage, change and reuse into the future.
* Demonstrate the sorting and ordering of match events from the JSON source
* Demonstrate good file and code structure

You will get more attention if your code is testable and you provide unit tests.

And if you need to fill any gaps in these vague requirements, then go ahead and make the assumptions you need. Just make sure to describe your assumptions in your solution.

## Submission
Please begin by forking this repository (or simply clone it if you do not want to submit using GitHub). To submit, add the following users as collaborators:

@onlydave  
@cusackd  
@ikerSportdec  
@Wogiebear  

If you don't wish to use GitHub for submission, add the project files to a suitable directory on Google Drive and share, or zip the project and send as an email attachment, to the following email
addresses:

conor.wogan@sportdec.com  
iker@sportdec.com   
daveb@sportdec.com  
davec@sportdec.com  

## Please include

1. When submitting, ideally replace this README.md with whatever documentation you think is relevant for us to understand your work, including assumptions or decisions you made in your approach.
2. Please also attach a screenshot of the UI layout of your app.

## Prescribed languages and tools
We are not a dogmatic organisation - you are free to choose the technologies you wish to use to implement this challenge. However, given the nature of the role, the following are preferable to us:

 * First preference would be to see a solution written in: ReactNative
 * After that: ReactJS, AngularJS or similar client side framework.
 * Demonstration of SASS/LESS or some CSS preprocessor
 * Demonstration of a build system such as gulp, grunt or webpack, see below.

## Non-functional requirements 
Ideally we would like the project to have its dependencies resolved with `npm`, `bower`, `yarn` or some combination of the above, and for us to be able to launch it with something along the lines of `npm start` (or another single command).
